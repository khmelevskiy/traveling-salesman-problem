# Traveling salesman problem
TSP using graphs (a greedy algorithm)

---
#**Input data:**
- Number of the top
- The beginning of the interval for weights
- End of the interval for weights

#**Output data**
each weight and general weight.
In a format (each weight+each weight+... = general weight).

**TSP** is that it is necessary to find the shortest way from the city of A to the city of D, having returned back to the city of A. 

---
**The greedy algorithm** consists in the following: we choose the minimum weight from all.

**TSP using graphs (a greedy algorithm)** consists in the following: we pass on all weights for "i" top and choose the smallest. We note top as visited and we begin with that top to which came (i = jValue). So proceeds until all tops aren't visited, then from last top we add weight for entrance top (entrance top = 1).
